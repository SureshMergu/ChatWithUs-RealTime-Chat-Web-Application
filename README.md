 ChatWithUs | Real-Time Chat Web Application
Welcome to my real-time chat web application project! 

This project showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, as I've developed a dynamic and feature-rich chat application with the following components:

Features:
User Authentication: Seamlessly manage user access with secure login and signup functionalities.
Active User List: View a list of actively available users, simplifying the process of connecting with others.
Chat Page: Engage in real-time conversations through an intuitive and user-friendly chat interface.
Logout: Effortlessly log out while ensuring data security.
Feel free to explore the codebase, examine the design choices, and dive into the inner workings of the application. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated as I continue to enhance and refine this project.
